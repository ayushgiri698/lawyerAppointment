Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm installed on your system.
    Basic knowledge of React, Redux, and Bootstrap is helpful.

The build files will be generated in the build/ folder, ready for deployment.
Deployment

To deploy this project using Netlify, follow these steps:

Future Enhancements

    Backend Integration: Currently, the project is frontend-only, but I plan to add backend functionality to persist data in a database.
    Search Functionality: Implement search filters to allow users to find lawyers based on specialty or availability.
    User Authentication: Add a login feature to manage user profiles and their appointment history.
